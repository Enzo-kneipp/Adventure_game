### Reflection

1. **Can I explain what my code does?**
   - Yes. The code controls story using a state management system(script.js). Based on the inputof the user, it updates the displayed question and provides the next set of choices(and has some nice styling as well).

2. **What was my coding process?**
   - My process was super rushed(i did all of this in less then 3 hrs and then had to put it in git hub because i forgot then i realized i did most of the java wrong and had to start over)buttttt.... firstly the plan was to do story paths, then build a basic structure in HTML, followed by implementing JavaScript for dynamic content. Finally, I added minimal styling and made the game accessible(ARIA).

3. **What challenges did I have?**
   - I faced challenges with state management and ensuring the correct code strucure was present.Not backing up on github(i tend to forget till im halfway through).

4. **What would I do differently now?**
   - I would implement more complex storylines(alot more) and possibly use more advanced techniques like storing user choices and saving the progress of the game(idk tho).
